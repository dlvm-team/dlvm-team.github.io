# Introduction

DLVM is a compiler infrastructure for modern deep learning software.

DLVM combines linear algebra operations, automatic differentiation, domain-specific optimizations, and a code generator targeting heterogeneous parallel hardware. DLVM is designed to support the development of neural networks DSLs, with both AOT And JIT compilation.
